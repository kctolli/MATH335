## Course Mission Statement

Use data-driven programming in R for the handling, formatting, and visualization of messy and complex data. Students will implement data wrangling techniques and the grammar of graphics process in visualizing complex data.

### Course Outcomes

At the completion of this course, successful students will be able to:

* Convert data from varied formats or structures to a tidy format for analysis and visualization.
* Clean, transform, and merge data attributes/variables appropriately.
* Effectively display and communicate meaning from spatial, temporal, and textual data.
* Articulate the process, benefits, and challenges of big data manipulation.
* Use current analysis, presentation, and collaboration tools in the data science field (E.g. R, Python, D3.js, GitHub, Slack, etc).

## Semester Deliverables

1. Completed LinkedIn, GitHub, Slack profiles that have been connected to our BYU-I data science community
2. A cover letter stating the key concepts and techniques that you learned during our projects and your goals to continue learning in this area - include a grade request that represents your knowledge and task completion
3. A resume that includes the skills you have learned during our projects
4. A semester task form that records your completed tasks during the semester
5. Semester project submission on GitHub
6. Submit this material electronically.
7. Bring a printed copy of your cover letter and resume and to our exit interview


### Coding Challenge

On the last day of class each of you will have the 1.5 hours of class to complete a coding challenge. You will not be able to work with others, but will be able to ask questions of the teacher in class. The coding challenge will use the techniques and programming developed from the course.

You must pass the challenge to keep grade earned from the completed tasks.

Failure to pass the challenge will lower your grade 1-2 steps.

### Semester Project

Each of you will be responsible to create a data driven question, find the data to answer this question, and build a visual analysis that answers your question with data.    
A few notes on this project;

* This project is done over a semester. If you try to complete it during the last week of the semester you will not succeed.
* The data science majors will submit this as a part of their degree completion. This project could be a great stepping stone for your senior project.
* I would highly recommend that you do this project well and make it public on your Github repository to demonstrate to employers that you have data programming skills.

## Specifications Grading

As we team, teacher and student, we have a challenge to become more in three months! We have worked hard to identify the specifications needed for a data visualization specialist (as an undergraduate). My goal is to align your grade with the skill specification you have mastered. In other words, the grade you want will determine how much work you will do. Individual tasks in the class will not be traditionally graded. If your work meets the specified criteria you will get full credit and only then (there is no partial credit on tasks).

In a specifications-grading system all tasks are evaluated on a high-standards pass/fail basis using detailed checklists of task requirements and expectations. Letter grades are earned by passing marks on a set of tasks. This system provides for a variety of choice and is closer to how learning, and work, is done in the real world. It will be easy for us to tell if work is complete, done in good faith, and consistent with the requirements.
