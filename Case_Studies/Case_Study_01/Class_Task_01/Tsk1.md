## Background
To create graphics that clearly answer questions, you must understand the basics of how the human perceptual system works. This 40-minute talk by John Rauser, a data scientist in the technology industry, will give you an overview. You can find the code for the majority of his graphics here.

You will also be responsible for getting R and Rstudio installed and running.
